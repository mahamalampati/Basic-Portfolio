            I (Maha) know that I am special and there's no one else out there that's like me... so enjoy! (smile)
            
            I was born in India on October 16, 1986. I had a very simple and happy childhood, and my only sibling, my elder Sister, just two years elder to me.
            
            Like my dad, I am introverted and am perfectly happy watching quality movies or using a personal computer during my spare time.I lived in Boston, Mass for an year.I lived in Houston, texas, and then moved to kansas city a year back.

            I like travelling and meeting new people.
